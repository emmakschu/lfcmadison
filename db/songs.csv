1|You'll Never Walk Alone|The most important LFC song. Originally from the Rodgers & Hammerstein musical Carousel, YNWA is today best known as a football anthem and for Gerry & The Pacemakers hit version from 1963. When 46,000 Liverpool supporters are singing it in unison, it is simply breathtaking. YNWA isn't just a song, it's the Reds' way of life.|<p>When you walk through a storm,<br>Hold your head up high,<br>And don't be afraid of the dark.<br>At the end of the storm,<br>There's a golden sky,<br>And the sweet silver song of the lark.</p><p>Walk on, through the wind,<br>Walk on, through the rain,<br>Though your dreams be tossed and blown,<br>Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart<br>And you'll never walk alone<br>You'll never walk alone.</p>|https://www.youtube.com/embed/ctbNzW9gc_A
2|We Won it Five Times|Originally written as We'll Win it Five Times during the 2005 Champions League campaign, it was quickly altered when Stevie G had indeed lifted that fifth European Cup at the Atat&uuml;rk Stadium.|<p>We won it at Wembley<br>We won it in Gay Paris<br>In '77 and '84 it was Rome</p><p>We've won it five times<br>We've won it five times<br>In Istanbul, we've won it five times</p><p>When Emlyn lifted it high<br>He lit up the Roman sky<br>Thommo in Paris, and Souness did it as well<br>We've won it five times...</p><p>We won it at Wembley, our home<br>Took 26,000 to Rome<br>20,000 to Paris, when we won it again<br>We've won it five times...</p><p>Stevie G's eyes lit up<br>As he lifted the European Cup<br>21 years and now it's coming back home<br>We've won it five times...</p>|http://www.youtube.com/embed/KEZTpwIsFb0
3|Fields of Anfield Road|Fields of Anfield Road is one of the most popular songs in the Kop, although usually just the chorus is heard during matches. The song is adapted from the Irish folk ballad "Fields of Athenry" by Pete St John.|<p>Outside the Shankly Gates<br>I heard a Kopite calling:<br>Shankly, they have taken you away<br>But you left a great eleven<br>Before you went to heaven<br>Now it's glory 'round the Fields of Anfield Road</p><p>All 'round the Fields of Anfield Road<br>Where once we watched the King Kenny play<br>&mdash; and could he play!<br>Stevie Heighway on the wing<br>We had dreams and songs to sing<br>Of the glory 'round the Fields of Anfield Road</p><p>Outside the Paisley Gates<br>I heard a Kopite calling:<br>Paisley, they have taken you away<br>You led the great eleven<br>Back in Rome in '77<br>And the Redmen, they're still playing the same way</p><p>All 'round the Fields of Anfield Road...</p>|http://www.youtube.com/embed/lvKG467Ocvw

6|Poor Scouser Tommy|One of the oldest extant Kop songs, Poor Scouser Tommy dates back to the 1960s. However, it is also one of the more complicated selections.|<p>Let me tell you the story of a poor boy<br>Who was sent far away from his home<br>To fight for his king and his country<br>And also the old folks back home<br>So they put him in a Highland division<br>Sent him off to a far foreign land<br>Where the flies swarm around in their thousands<br>And there's nothing to see but the sand</p><p>Now the battle it started next morning<br>Under the Arabian sun<br>I remember that Poor Scouser Tommy<br>He was shot by an old Nazi gun<br>As he lay on the battlefield dying (dying, dying)<br>With the blood gushing out of his head<br>As he lay on the battlefield dying (dying, dying)<br>These were the last words he said:</p><p>Oh, I am a Liverpudlian<br>And I come from the Spion Kop<br>I like to sing, I like to chant<br>I go there quite a lot (every week!)<br>Support a team that's dressed in red<br>A team that we all know<br>A team the we call LIVERPOOL!<br>And to glory we will go</p><p>We've won the league, we've won the Cup<br>We've been to Europe too<br>We played the Toffees for a laugh<br>And left them feeling blue (five-nil!)</p><p>One, two<br>One, two, three<br>One, two, three, four<br>Five-nil!</p><p>Rush scored one<br>Rush scored two<br>Rush scored three and Rush scored four<br>Na na na na na na na na na</p><p>All you need is Rush</p>|https://www.youtube.com/embed/-glvuTZMiEA
